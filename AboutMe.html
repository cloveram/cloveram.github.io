<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Andrew Mayhew.  I love art. I've been drawing traditional and digital for <em>10+ years</em> and have been doing it “professionally" for 3 years. I do commissions for others mostly of their original characters or portraits of pets. In my freetime I enjoy hiking and  playing video games of all types of genres but I especially love horror games.

  I plan to take a gap year next year to earn some money to support myself, and take some community college classes . I plan to travel a lot in my gap year as well to get more of a feel of what I want to do in the future. My main goal is to just be happy and pursue things that make me happy. I think I'd like to work for an animation studio working on storyboards or a film studio doing the same kind of thing. 
  
  I’ve entered some competitive art competitions. The first one I submitted material to is the Seventh International Sea Duck conference.  It was really exciting. All the pieces will be displayed even if you don’t win! This is a good way to get my name out to the industry. I'm also working on building my social media presence to showcase my artwork.
